Again, great job Tommy 20/20.

I really don't have any constructive critisism so I'll make some very minor points.

1)

	"checkAge" could be named better.  What is it checking? age exists? over some age? under some age? etc


2)
	PlayList class is tightly coupled with the given set of genres.  It should work with any genres. So
		a) Don't inject the genres directly into it.
		b) Can't have this because the genres themselves might change..
			Playlist.addToPlaylist(this.songs.jazzList, this.playList);
			Playlist.addToPlaylist(this.songs.hiphopList, this.playList);
			Playlist.addToPlaylist(this.songs.rockList, this.playList

			what if tomorrow we add/remove a genre?

Just some things to think about.

Great Job
